Instagram photos reveal predictive markers of depression.

## Description
In a study conducted by a Harvard researcher Andrew G. Reece, it was concluded that there were key indicators of depression that lie within one's Instagram profile.
The computer trained model was able to outperform the average general practitioner whose success rate for diagnonsis was around 42%.

Picture Perfect is a piece of software which
* fetches a user's instagram profile
* downloads all the images from posts
* uses several key indicators of depression from social media to assign a *health score*
* displays the likelihood of that instagram user having depression

**Abstract**
Using Instagram data from 166 individuals, we applied machine learning tools to
successfully identify markers of depression. Statistical features were computationally extracted
from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color analysis, metadata components, and
algorithmic face detection. Resulting models outperformed general practitioners’ average
diagnostic success rate for depression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted
to posts made before depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Photos posted by depressed
individuals were more likely to be bluer, grayer, and darker. Human ratings of photo attributes
(happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of depression, and were uncorrelated with
computationally­generated features. These findings suggest new avenues for early screening
and detection of mental illness.
